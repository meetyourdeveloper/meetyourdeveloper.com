  <p>In recent years I have assisted clients with several impactful initiatives; here are just a few:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Integration of a rewards program that added customer incentive and foot traffic in retail stores leading to <em><strong>increased</strong></em> revenue</li>
    <li>Refactored a payment workflow that <em><strong>fixed</em></strong> errors, <em><strong>reduced</em></strong> customer confusion, and in turn <em><strong>minimized</em></strong> cost through support needed</li>
    <li>Built out a high availability infrastructure with redundancies, distributed load, and daily backups that <em><strong>maximized</em></strong> uptime all the while <em><strong>eliminating</em></strong> points of failure</li>
    <li>Created a b2b solution for iOS and Android that <em><strong>simplified</em></strong> the barrier of entry for new customers and <em><strong>opened up</em></strong> a new market segment</li>
    <li>Designed and implemented utilities that have prioritized transaction transparency and <span class="highlight"><em><strong>prevented the loss of millions of dollars</em></strong></span></li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Effective solutions and positive results</h2>

  <h4>
    Syrinx Consulting Corporation
    <small>Lead Developer of Mobile Payment Solutions, March 2013 - Present</small>
  </h4>

  <p>
    I started consulting with Syrinx in early 2013 and moved up the ranks fast. I have directly worked with marketing on initiatives related to branding, design, and UI / UX, resulting in better accessibility on both desktop and mobile browsers. I have performed discovery on both new technology and several problem domains to better empower management regarding customer acquisition and leveraging of said technologies. I have attended several meetings representing the company as an advisor, have diagnosed customer problems, proposed solutions, and written several statements of work on behalf of the company.

  <h5>Cumberland Farms</h5>

  <p>
    From friends and family launch, to public release, to growing pains, I have been involved with the Cumberland Farm's SmartPay platform. I increased customer engagement through integration of a rewards program, added in-store promotions within their app, and overhauled their maps by adding filtering by product, hours, and location. I stopped headaches by being their go-to developer for maintaining their infrastructure, APIs, third party integrations, and their iOS, Android, and mobile web applications. I helped foster better customer relations by advising on UX, API workflows, and third party integrations to prevent negative impacts. I reduced costs by taking a document driven and a test first approach that has led to easier on-boarding of new developers. I also leveraged existing tools and libraries to further minimize the required developers needed to properly maintain the application. I maximized uptime by building out a high availability server setup which could incur multiple server failures and still preform at peak load.

  <h5>Localytics</h5>

  <p>
    Localytics brought me on to handle the implementation of a third party payment system. I assisted with the planning and design of the integration, which led to greater customer acquisition through ease of use and modern design. I boosted productivity by working with third party contractors on behalf of Localytics, preventing misunderstandings and gaps in communication. I built several modules to break out complexity and ease understanding of the payment library. I was flexible with the client's schedule while still maintaining a high level of efficiency, preventing the project from running longer than needed.

  <h4>
    Tomorrow Pictures Inc.
    <small>Senior Software Engineer, October 2011 - April 2013</small>
  </h4>

  <p>
    I joined the Tomorrow Pictures team in late 2011 as a Senior Software Engineer. I planned, created, and advised on in-house applications that led to increased productivity of the team. I assisted in sales and planning meetings with clients to help diagnose problems and present effective solutions. I increased reliability of their customers' sites by transitioning them to newly provisioned servers with added security and uptime. I reduced expenses by producing a white label solution for a reoccurring project, eliminating a majority of the overhead.

  <p>
    The Tech industry moves fast, and after a while (say 5 years) you get diminishing returns regarding relevant experience. Prior to the work listed above I started as a Junior Web Developer and soon moved on to contract work. If you want to talk shop about old projects feel free to shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:email@richardrissanen.com">email@richardrissanen.com</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>In the works</h2>

  <p>I have serveral projects in the works that I hope to release by the end of the year.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Tom, Doc and Harriet:</strong> In recent years I have become obsessed with documentation, testing, and the D.R.Y. principle. This has led me to create a Ruby library that leverages the <a href="http://tomdoc.org">TomDoc Spec</a> to run unit tests within inline documentation. This prevents one from having to write both examples and unit tests because they will be one and the same.</li>
    <li><strong>Starting Now:</strong> an iOS and watchOS app coming soon.</li>
    <li><strong>Responsive HTML 5 Templates:</strong> I favor <a href="http://purecss.io">purecss.io</a> for responsive web design due to its minimal approach and plug-and-play nature; however, I end up writing the implementation from scratch every time. This project is going to stop that.</li>
    <li><strong>Un-named Event App:</strong> Several years ago I wrote a festival app in a day. I was frustrated with a local festivalâ€™s lack of mobile support and wanted to ensure I got to see all the bands I loved. This is a rebuild / white label solution of that because I have run into several events that had the same problem over the years.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Currently all of these projects are private but many of them will be either open sourced or released soon.</p>

  <h2>Moving forward</h2>

  <p>
    I am interested in solving your difficult problems and producing meaningful results. By cultivating relationships with other consultants and companies, if I am not a good fit for your project, I will suggest someone who is. Further engagement with the tech community will help keep me aware of the best technologies to leverage for your project. Through pushing a document driven approach to consulting I&#8217;ll increase transparency of what is being done and reduce on-boarding time of any developers during / post my involvement. Questioning the status quo (this digital resume, for example) and assisting in diagnosis of your needs will allow me properly solve your problems.
