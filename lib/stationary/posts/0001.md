    If someone asked for your resume right now, would you have it on you? If your resume is online, it is always available when opportunities present themselves. Imagine running into a potential client in a coffee shop over the weekend. They ask for something more formal than your elevator pitch. What will you give them?
  </p>

  <p>
    If someone asked for your resume right now, would it be up to date? Opportunity is a fleeting mistress; you never know when she will show up. It is imperative that you keep your resume relevant. At <a href="http://www.meetyourdeveloper.com">MeetYourDeveloper.com</a> we suggest any event of merit should be a trigger to update your resume.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>When you finish a project? <em>Update your resume</em>.</li>
    <li>Learn a new language or framework? <em>Update your resume</em>.</li>
    <li>Released a new version of an open source project? <em>Update your resume</em>.</li>
    <li>Integrated with a popular third-party API? <strong>Update your resume!</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Your resume should be a living document: always online, always up to date, and always ready when someone asks.
